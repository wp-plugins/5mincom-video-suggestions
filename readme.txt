The "ADD TO POST" button will place a thumbnail of the initial video in your list at the current cursor location. This thumbnail is a graphic representation of the player with the loaded videos. The actual player will only be visible after submitting your article.

The "Grab code" procedure allows you to copy the code containing all of your Player and video information and paste it anywhere in your article.

Note: The "Grab code" procedure results only appear in your article after it is submitted or by  changing the article to an HTML view via a third-party product.

= How does automatic matching work in the CMS plugin? =
Automatic matching scans your article and offers videos related to the content. It's a hassle free way of adding a video to every article on your site.

== Content ==

= What does an Expiration Date mean in the Video Information? =
Only the owner of a vWhat does the Geo-Restriction mean in the video information?ideo can define an Expiration Date. When a video's expiration date arrives, the video is removed from syndication and will no longer be available, even if it is embedded in your article.

= What does the Geo-Restriction mean in the video information? =
The Content Owner sets Geo-Restrictions and specifies the regions in which the video will be available. This is useful for those owners who want to target a country specific or continent-specific audience.

If a viewer outside the specified region tries playing a Geo-Restricted video, they will see a message in the player informing them that the video is not available in their region.

= Can I control the Pre-Roll advertisements that play in front of videos I embed? =
Yes. If there is a conflict of interest, you can block an advertisement or advertiser from displaying on your page.
