== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I control the Pre-Roll advertisements that play in front of videos I embed? =
Yes. If there is a conflict of interest, you can block an advertisement or advertiser from displaying on your page. To block an advertisement/advertiser, gather relevant information (i.e., the advertiser's name, product name and take a screenshot of the advertisement), and then contact your Account Manager.

= What does an Expiration Date mean in the Video Information? =
Only the owner of a video can define an Expiration Date. When a video's expiration date arrives, the video is removed from syndication and will no longer be available, even if it is embedded in your article.

= What is a playlist? =
A Playlist is a pre-existing group of videos. Each playlist has its own unique ID.

= How does automatic matching work in the CMS plugin? =
Our player's default size is 570W x 531H. You can change this to fit your requirement. However, we do recommend keeping a 4/3 or 16/9 ratio.

= Can I customize the default player's size within the CMS Plugin? =
Yes. The default size can be changed in the plugin panel's Cusrtomized Layout section. 

= Can I customize the default player's colors within the CMS Plugin? =
Yes. The colors can be changed in the plugin panel's Advanced Option section.

= What does the Geo-Restriction mean in the video information? =
The Content Owner sets Geo-Restrictions and specifies the regions in which the video will be available. This is useful for those owners who want to target a country specific or continent-specific audience.

If a viewer outside the specified region tries playing a Geo-Restricted video, they will see a message in the player informing them that the video is not available in their region.

= In the Search Results screen, what does the dynamic icon at the bottom right of each result thumbnail mean? =
+ When the video can be added to The AOL On Network Video Plugin panel's selection list, the icon appears with a plus sign (+).
+ When the video has already been added to The AOL On Network Video Plugin panel's selection list, the icon appears with a checkmark.
+ When the video has already been added to The AOL On Network Video Plugin panel's selection list and you mouse over the thumbnail, the icon appears with a minus sign (-) indicating that the video can be removed from the selection list.

Click the icon (+ or -) to add or remove a video from the selection list. 

= Can I change the appearance of the Search Results screen? =
Yes. The two buttons below the Search field, on the right, allow you to change the appearance of the Search Results screen. The first button changes it to Large Thumbnails and the second button changes it to Details

= How can I see more information about a video in the Search Results screen before I decide if it belongs in my selection list? =
Mouse over the thumbnail to display more detailed information about a video. If you want even more information, click the thumbnail to open the a player that includes more details about the video. 

= Why is some of the text in the video information red? =
The red text indicates restrictions placed on a video. These restriction may include geographic restriction, expiration dates, etc.

= What's the difference between the "ADD TO POST" button and "Grab code" procedure? =
The "ADD TO POST" button will place a thumbnail of the initial video in your list at the current cursor location. This thumbnail is a graphic representation of the player with the loaded videos. The actual player will only be visible after submitting your article.

The "Grab code" procedure allows you to copy the code containing all of your Player and video information and paste it anywhere in your article.

Note: The "Grab code" procedure results only appear in your article after it is submitted or by  changing the article to an HTML view via a third-party product.
